##Qlineshop Website redesign for Quinko-Tek

This website was redesigned for Quinko-Tek International as their international storefront.  It was built on the Opencart CMS.   I oversaw updating the entire website product catalog, photography and the redesign to  improve the UI/UX.  The second phase of the project was a port over to Magento CMS which remains in development phase.
